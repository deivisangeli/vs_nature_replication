# Replication code for "Do Virtue Signals Signal Virtue?"
This repo was prepared to accompany our submission to Nature. The anonymized data included allows the reader to replicate all our tables and figures.

Clone the repository to your local environment, set the working directory to the repository root (in each do-file) and pick where you want the output folders (just change the code at the top of each do-file). The do-files will produce all paper exhibits. Running the complete do-files may take 5 to 20 minutes.

# Requirements
Do-files were run in Stata 17, on different Windows environments. The following additional packages need to be installed via `ssc install`:
- blindschemes
- estout
- coefplot
- reghdfe
- listtab
- labutil
- distinct
- parmest
